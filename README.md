Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project-2
===================================
This is for the 2nd project. 

The script run_analysis.R does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Rawdata:
The x_train.txt and x_test.txt files contain measures for the featiures. 
The y_train.txt and y_test.txt files contain activity labels for the measures of the features.
The subjects_train.txt and subjects_test.txt files contain the subject ID of the training and test data sets.

Prerequisite: 
The raw data folder UCI HAR Dataset needs to be unzipped and put on the following path: 

~/Desktop/R/Tidy_Data
